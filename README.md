# ‚ôæÔ∏è Focus Helper: ATC Edition

### DISCLAIMER: This project is a bullshit!


A personal focus assistant that simulates an Air Traffic Control (ATC) tower to help you disconnect from the computer and avoid hyperfocus.

### Why does this project exist?

For many autistic and neurodivergent individuals, **hyperfocus** is a common experience. While it can be a superpower for productivity, it can also lead to burnout and neglecting basic needs. Generic "take a break" alerts are often jarring, ineffective, and easy to dismiss. **Focus Helper** offers a novel solution by transforming these interruptions into an engaging, immersive experience that respects the user's special interests.

By simulating an **Air Traffic Control (ATC)** tower, it uses a creative, aviation-themed approach to deliver critical alerts. Instead of a simple notification, users receive a "radio call" with urgent instructions, dynamically generated by the **Llama 3.2 AI**, making the process of disconnecting more effective and enjoyable.

### Key Features ‚ôæÔ∏è

* **Immersive & Engaging Alerts**: Instead of simple pop-ups, the application delivers "radio calls" with urgent, aviation-themed instructions, transforming a disruptive alert into an immersive experience.
* **AI-Powered Personalization**: Alerts are dynamically generated using a language model, like **Llama 3.2**, which makes the experience more unpredictable and personalized than a static notification.
* **Hyperfocus Intervention**: The ATC simulation is a creative way to interrupt a hyperfocus state by leveraging a special interest (aviation) to encourage the user to disengage from their work and take a necessary break.
* **Respects Neurodivergence**: The project acknowledges that generic break reminders can be jarring for many people and offers a solution that is both functional and respectful of different cognitive styles.

### Setup Instructions with Docker and Makefile üê≥

This project uses Docker to create a portable environment and a `Makefile` to simplify the process of building and running the container.

#### Prerequisites

* **Docker and Docker Compose**: Make sure Docker and Docker Compose are installed and running on your system.
* **Make**: The `make` utility is required to run the commands defined in the `Makefile`.
* **Voice Models**: You need to download the voice models for the project to work.
* **Ollama**: You need to have Ollama installed and running to use the AI model.

#### Downloading the Voice Models

Before you can build the project, you need to download the voice model files. The project uses the **Cadu** voice model for Brazilian Portuguese.

1.  **Create the `voices` directory**: In the root of your project, create a folder named `voices`.

    ```bash
    mkdir voices
    ```

2.  **Download the `.onnx` model file**: This file contains the trained neural network model. ( warning you are downloading portuguese voice version. Take a look at https://huggingface.co/rhasspy/piper-voices for other voices )

    ```bash
    wget -O voices/pt_BR-cadu-medium.onnx  https://huggingface.co/rhasspy/piper-voices/resolve/v1.0.0/pt/pt_BR/cadu/medium/pt_BR-cadu-medium.onnx?download=true
    ```

3.  **Download the `.json` configuration file**: This file provides the metadata and settings.

    ```bash
    wget -O voices/pt_BR-cadu-medium.onnx.json https://huggingface.co/rhasspy/piper-voices/resolve/v1.0.0/pt/pt_BR/cadu/medium/pt_BR-cadu-medium.onnx.json?download=true
    ```

#### How to Use the `Makefile`

The `Makefile` defines several targets (commands) that you can run from your terminal.

1.  **Build the Docker Image**: This command compiles your Go application and creates the final Docker image.
    ```bash
    make build
    ```

2.  **Run the Container**: This executes the `entrypoint.sh` script, which launches the container with the necessary configurations for audio and GUI support.
    ```bash
    make run
    ```
    *Note: The `entrypoint.sh` script must be present and correctly configured to run the Docker container.*

3.  **Rebuild the Image**: If you've made changes to the `Dockerfile` or source code, this command will clean the old image and build a new one.
    ```bash
    make rebuild
    ```

4.  **Stop the Container**: To stop and remove the running container, use:
    ```bash
    make stop
    ```

5.  **View Logs**: To see the output from your running container in real-time, use:
    ```bash
    make logs
    ```

6.  **Clean Up**: This command stops the container and removes the Docker image from your system.
    ```bash
    make clean
    ```
